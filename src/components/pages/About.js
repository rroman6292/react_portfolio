                    My name is Richard Roman and I was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. I moved to Orlando when I was 5 years old and I have been here ever since. I graduated from Colonial High School in 2005 and started working various jobs. Eventually I enrolled at Valencia in 2009 and in 2012 I received my Associates Degree and from their enrolled at UCF. I graduated from UCF in 2015 with a Bachelors Degree in Interdisciplinary Studies.After graduating, I was in an admin position for about 2 years at a dry ice distribution facility. They went through some downsizing and I became the manager there for a year and 9 months. Due to COVID and the already tight budget we had, my tenure came to an end in September of 2020 at which point I was at a crossroads as the job market was scarce. After some dialogue with my wife, I decided to take a leap and join the UCF coding boot camp. I started in December and I can't wait to see where this journey goes.
